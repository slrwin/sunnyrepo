[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.85[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Settings->Content->General->"Service used for Because You Watched". Choose which service provides recommendations for the Because You Watched menus. Options are Recommended (TMDb) or More Like This (IMDb). TMDb by default.

- Added Settings->Content->General->"Seeds used for Because You Watched Random". Choose how much previously watched media is used for recommendations for the Because You Watched Random menu. You can choose from the previous 1 to 5 watched items as the list from which the seed will be added.
- Partial fix for Parental Guidance in Extras window. IMDb look to be in the process of changing this on their website, so if the new layout loads, it will still not work. Clear Main Cache to clear any null values for this.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Added 'Anime' section to Root Menu (Main Menu). To add this, context menu on any current Root Menu item->Check for New Menu Items. Add the Anime menu item where you please. If this doesn't work, then select Context Menu->Restore Menu.
- Anime is also included in the "Random Lists" menu, where the Anime lists can be randomized just like the Movie and TV Show lists.
- Added Settings->Content->General->"Watched (Still Airing) TV Shows Location". Select from "Watched", "In Progress" or "Both". This decides which menu fully watched, but still airing, TV Shows will be included in. Default is "Watched" (which is the current behavior).
